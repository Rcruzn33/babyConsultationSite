# How to Fix Git Connection in Replit

## Where to Find the Shell/Terminal

1. **In Replit, look at the bottom tabs** - you should see:
   - Console
   - Shell (this is where you type commands)
   - Git (this is where you're seeing the error)

2. **Click on "Shell" tab** - this opens the terminal where you can type commands

## Commands to Fix the Git Connection

Once you're in the Shell tab, type these commands one by one:

### Step 1: Navigate to the correct folder
```bash
cd github-deploy
```

### Step 2: Check current status
```bash
git status
```

### Step 3: Pull from remote (this might fix the connection)
```bash
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

### Step 4: Add all files
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 5: Commit changes
```bash
git commit -m "Upload complete baby sleep website"
```

### Step 6: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push origin main
```

## If Commands Don't Work

If the Shell tab is not available or commands don't work:

1. **Use the manual upload method** I described earlier
2. **Go directly to GitHub** and upload files through the web interface
3. **Copy and paste** the file contents I provided

## Alternative: Reset Git Connection

If the above doesn't work, try:

```bash
cd github-deploy
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/Rcruzn33/babyConsultationSite.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

The Shell tab is your terminal - that's where you can type these Git commands!
