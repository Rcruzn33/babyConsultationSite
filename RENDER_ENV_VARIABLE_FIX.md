# Final SSL Fix - Environment Variable Approach

## Current Status
- Build: ✅ Successful
- Port: ✅ Working (5000)
- SSL: ❌ Still failing

Port 5432 is correct for PostgreSQL - that's not the issue.

## Direct Render Dashboard Fix

Instead of code changes, modify the environment variable directly in Render:

### Step 1: Go to Render Dashboard
1. Find your baby sleep website service
2. Go to "Environment" tab
3. Find the DATABASE_URL variable

### Step 2: Update DATABASE_URL
Add SSL parameters to your existing DATABASE_URL:

**If your current DATABASE_URL is:**
```
postgresql://username:password@host:5432/database
```

**Change it to:**
```
postgresql://username:password@host:5432/database?sslmode=require&sslcert=&sslkey=&sslrootcert=
```

**Or try this simpler version:**
```
postgresql://username:password@host:5432/database?ssl=true
```

### Step 3: Also Check These Environment Variables
Ensure these are set:
- `NODE_ENV` = `production`
- `SESSION_SECRET` = any random string
- `PORT` = (should be automatic)

### Step 4: Redeploy
After changing DATABASE_URL, click "Manual Deploy"

## Alternative: Use Different Connection Method
If the above doesn't work, we might need to switch from `pg-pool` to a different PostgreSQL client that handles SSL better with your specific database provider.

## Why This Should Work
- Modifying the connection string at the environment level bypasses any code-level SSL configuration issues
- This is the most direct way to ensure SSL parameters are properly passed to PostgreSQL
- Many cloud databases require specific SSL parameters in the connection string

Try the environment variable approach first - this often resolves SSL issues that code-level fixes can't address.
