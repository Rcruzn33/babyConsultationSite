# How to Get Files from github-deploy Folder

Since you can't download the entire folder directly, here are the easiest methods:

## Method 1: Copy Files One by One (Recommended)

I'll show you the content of each critical file. Copy and paste them into new files in your GitHub repository:

### Critical Files to Copy:
1. `package.json` - Contains all dependencies
2. `vite.config.ts` - Build configuration  
3. `tailwind.config.ts` - Styling configuration
4. `postcss.config.js` - CSS processing
5. `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
6. `components.json` - UI components
7. `drizzle.config.ts` - Database configuration

### Folders to Recreate:
- `client/src/` - React frontend files
- `server/` - Express backend files
- `shared/` - Shared code
- `attached_assets/` - Your images

## Method 2: Use File Viewer

I can show you the content of any file by using the file viewer. Just ask me to show specific files and you can copy the content.

## Method 3: Manual Upload Strategy

1. Create the folder structure in GitHub first
2. Upload files section by section
3. Start with root config files
4. Then upload each folder

Would you like me to show you the content of the key files so you can copy them to your GitHub repository?
