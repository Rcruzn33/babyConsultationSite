# Production Blog/Testimonial Debug Fix

## Current Status
- ✅ Database has 8 blog posts (all published)
- ✅ Database has 4 testimonials (all approved)
- ❌ Production API endpoints failing

## Changes Made
Added detailed logging to production API endpoints:
- Blog endpoint now logs request parameters and results
- Testimonial endpoint now logs request parameters and results
- Added error stack traces for better debugging

## Next Steps
1. Update `server/routes.ts` on GitHub with the logging changes
2. Commit with message: "Add logging to debug blog/testimonial API endpoints"
3. Redeploy on Render
4. Check Render logs for detailed error information

## Expected Results
After deployment, the Render logs should show:
- What parameters are being passed to the API
- How many records are being fetched
- Exact error messages and stack traces

## Sample Data Available
**Published Blog Posts:**
- "5 Gentle Sleep Training Methods That Actually Work"
- "Understanding Baby Sleep Cycles"
- "Creating the Perfect Bedtime Routine"

**Approved Testimonials:**
- Carly Wetanson
- Dorsa Saeedi
- Jake Lazarowitz

This data should display on the production website once the API issue is resolved.
