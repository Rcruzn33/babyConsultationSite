# Baby Sleep Consulting Website

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for a baby sleep consulting business called "Happy Baby Sleeping". The application serves as both a public-facing website for potential clients and an admin dashboard for managing business operations. Built with modern web technologies, it provides a complete solution for a sleep consulting practice including contact management, consultation booking, blog content management, and customer testimonials.

## System Architecture

The application follows a traditional full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend:

- **Frontend**: React-based single-page application built with Vite
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication using express-session with PostgreSQL store
- **File Storage**: Local file system for image uploads
- **Email**: SendGrid integration for transactional emails

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **UI Components**: Custom components built on Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui styling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom theme colors (baby-blue, soft-pink, etc.)
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Custom auth middleware with password hashing using Node.js crypto
- **File Uploads**: Multer middleware for handling image uploads
- **Session Management**: express-session with connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session store
- **Email Service**: SendGrid for automated email notifications

### Database Schema
The application uses five main tables:
- **users**: Admin user management with role-based permissions
- **contacts**: Contact form submissions from website visitors
- **consultations**: Consultation booking requests with status tracking
- **blog_posts**: CMS for blog content with published/draft states
- **testimonials**: Customer testimonials with approval workflow

## Data Flow

1. **Public Website Flow**:
   - Visitors browse services, blog posts, and testimonials
   - Contact forms and consultation bookings are submitted via API
   - Data is stored in PostgreSQL and email notifications are sent

2. **Admin Authentication Flow**:
   - New admins register and await approval from existing admins
   - Session-based authentication maintains login state
   - Role-based permissions control access to different admin functions

3. **Content Management Flow**:
   - Admins create and manage blog posts with rich text content
   - Image uploads are handled locally and served statically
   - Content approval workflows for testimonials and user accounts

## External Dependencies

- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Database connection pool for PostgreSQL
- **@sendgrid/mail**: Email service for transactional emails
- **@radix-ui/***: Headless UI component primitives
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management and caching
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database ORM
- **express-session**: Session management
- **multer**: File upload handling
- **zod**: Runtime type validation

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured for deployment on Replit with the following setup:
- **Build Process**: Vite builds the frontend, esbuild bundles the backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20 with PostgreSQL 16
- **Environment**: Development and production modes with different configurations
- **Static Assets**: Frontend builds to `dist/public`, backend to `dist/`
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle migrations managed via `drizzle-kit`

The deployment uses autoscale targeting with build and run commands configured for production deployment. Local development runs both frontend and backend in parallel with hot reloading enabled.
