# Alternative Fix for Render Build Issue

## Problem
Even after updating package.json, Vite is still not found during build.

## Solution 1: Change Build Command in Render

Instead of moving dependencies, change your Render build command to install dev dependencies:

### In Render Dashboard:
1. Go to your service settings
2. Change **Build Command** from:
   ```bash
   npm install && npm run build
   ```
   to:
   ```bash
   npm ci --include=dev && npm run build
   ```

## Solution 2: Alternative Build Command
If that doesn't work, try:
```bash
npm install --production=false && npm run build
```

## Solution 3: Use npx
Change build command to:
```bash
npm install && npx vite build && npx esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist
```

## Solution 4: Manual Package.json Check
Your package.json might not have updated correctly. Please verify these items are in the main "dependencies" section:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "vite": "^5.4.14",
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.3.2",
    "esbuild": "^0.25.0",
    "tsx": "^4.19.1",
    "typescript": "5.6.3"
  }
}
```

## Quick Test
Try Solution 1 first - change the build command to include dev dependencies. This is the fastest fix without editing files.

## Why This Happens
- Render's default npm install only installs production dependencies
- Build tools like Vite are typically in devDependencies
- Need to explicitly install dev dependencies for build process
