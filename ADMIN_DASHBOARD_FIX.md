# Admin Dashboard Session Fix

## Problem Identified
The admin dashboard was not loading content on Render production site due to session cookie issues. After successful login, API calls to protected endpoints were failing with "Not authenticated" errors.

## Root Cause
The session cookie configuration had `secure: true` for production, which was preventing cookies from being properly maintained in the Render environment.

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed session cookie settings**: Changed `secure: false` to allow cookies to work
2. **Added session debugging**: Added console logging to track authentication state
3. **Maintained other security settings**: Kept `httpOnly: true` and `sameSite: "lax"`

## Files Modified
- `production-server.js` - Session configuration and auth middleware

## Testing After Deployment
1. Visit: https://babyconsultationsite.onrender.com/admin/auth
2. Login with: `admin` / `password123`
3. Admin dashboard should now show content tabs with data
4. All sections (Contacts, Consultations, Blog Posts, Testimonials) should load properly

## Expected Behavior
- Login redirects to admin dashboard
- All tabs display data from database
- No "Not authenticated" errors in console
- Session maintains across page refreshes
