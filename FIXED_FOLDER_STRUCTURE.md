# Fixed Folder Structure for GitHub Upload

## The Problem
Your build was failing because the folder structure in your GitHub repository doesn't match what the build system expects.

## The Solution
I've fixed the folder structure. You need to upload these changes to your GitHub repository:

### Required Folder Structure:
```
your-repo/
├── client/
│   └── src/
│       ├── App.tsx
│       ├── main.tsx
│       ├── index.css
│       ├── components/
│       ├── hooks/
│       ├── lib/
│       └── pages/
├── server/
├── shared/
├── attached_assets/
├── package.json
├── vite.config.ts
└── other config files...
```

## What You Need to Do:

1. **Delete the current `client-src` folder** in your GitHub repository
2. **Upload the new `client` folder** (with the `src` subfolder structure)
3. **Redeploy on Render**

## Quick Upload Steps:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Rcruzn33/babyConsultationSite
2. Delete the `client-src` folder
3. Upload the entire `client` folder from your `github-deploy` directory here
4. Commit changes
5. Go back to Render and trigger a new deployment

## Why This Fixes the Issue:
The build system expects files to be in `client/src/` but your files were in `client-src/`. This mismatch caused the "vite: not found" error because it couldn't locate the source files.

## After Upload:
Your Render build should now work correctly with:
- Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
- Start Command: `npm start`
