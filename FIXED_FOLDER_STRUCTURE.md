# Fix Git Connection Issue

## Problem
Your GitHub repository was cleared, but your local git still has references to the old remote branches. This causes the "Remote ref of current branch is missing" error.

## Solution

Since you can't use git commands directly due to restrictions, here's the easiest approach:

### Method 1: Upload Files Manually (Recommended)

1. **Ignore the git error** - it's just a sync issue
2. **Upload files directly to GitHub** using the web interface
3. **Use the content I provided** in the previous messages

### Method 2: Fix Git Connection (If you have shell access)

If you can access the terminal/shell:

```bash
cd github-deploy
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git add .
git commit -m "Upload complete baby sleep website"
git push origin main
```

### Method 3: Create New Repository Connection

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Get the new clone URL
3. Create a fresh connection

## Key Files to Upload

Since the git sync is broken, focus on manually uploading these critical files:

### Root Files:
- `package.json` (most important)
- `vite.config.ts`
- `tailwind.config.ts`
- `tsconfig.json`
- `drizzle.config.ts`
- `postcss.config.js`
- `components.json`

### Folders:
- `client/src/` (entire folder with all React files)
- `server/` (entire folder with all backend files)
- `shared/` (database schema)
- `attached_assets/` (your images)

## After Upload

Once files are uploaded to GitHub:
1. Go to Render
2. Trigger a new deployment
3. The build should work with the correct folder structure

The git error won't affect the deployment - it's just a local sync issue.
