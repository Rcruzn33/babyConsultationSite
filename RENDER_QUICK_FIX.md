# RENDER QUICK FIX - Hostname Resolution Error

## Progress Made âœ…
- SSL/TLS error is FIXED! 
- New error: "getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND host" - hostname resolution issue

## What This Means
The database connection is trying to connect but can't find the hostname. This suggests:
1. DATABASE_URL hostname might be incorrect
2. Network connectivity issue
3. Database service might be down

## Quick Debug Steps

### Step 1: Check Your DATABASE_URL Format
In Render dashboard, your DATABASE_URL should look like:
```
postgresql://username:password@ep-example-123456.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech:5432/database?sslmode=require
```

**Check for these common issues:**
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Verify the hostname is complete (includes .neon.tech or similar)
- Ensure port 5432 is included
- Username and password are correct

### Step 2: Verify Database Service Status
1. Check if your database provider (Neon/Supabase/etc.) is online
2. Test the connection from your local machine if possible
3. Verify the database hasn't been suspended or deleted

### Step 3: Test Connection
Try copying your DATABASE_URL and testing it locally:
```bash
psql "your-database-url-here"
```

### Step 4: Alternative DATABASE_URL Formats
If using Neon, try these formats:
```
postgresql://username:password@ep-example-123456.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech:5432/database?sslmode=require
```

If using Supabase:
```
postgresql://postgres:password@db.example.supabase.co:5432/postgres?sslmode=require
```

## Next Steps
1. Double-check your DATABASE_URL format in Render
2. Verify your database service is active
3. Try redeploying after confirming the URL is correct

The SSL issue is resolved - now we just need to fix the hostname resolution!
