# Port Timeout Fix - Render Deployment

## Issue Analysis
- Server is running on port 5000 correctly
- Database connection is working
- SSL issues resolved
- Render is scanning for port 10000 causing timeout

## Root Cause
Render expects the application to be available on the PORT environment variable, but there might be a mismatch between what Render expects and what the server is using.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Update Server Port Logic (Recommended)
Update `server/index.ts` to use port 10000 as fallback for production:

```typescript
// Use the PORT environment variable provided by Render, fallback to 10000 for production
const port = process.env.PORT || (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 10000 : 5000);
```

### Option 2: Check Render Environment Variables
In Render dashboard, ensure these environment variables are set:
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT` (should be automatically set by Render)
- `DATABASE_URL` (already working)
- `SESSION_SECRET`

### Option 3: Force Port 10000 in Production
If Render consistently expects port 10000:
```typescript
const port = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? 10000 : (process.env.PORT || 5000);
```

## Expected Result
- Server binds to correct port
- Render health check passes
- Website becomes accessible
- No more timeout errors

## Deploy Steps
1. Update server/index.ts with new port logic
2. Commit to GitHub
3. Redeploy on Render
4. Monitor logs for successful port binding

The database and SSL issues are resolved - this is just a port configuration fix!
